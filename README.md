# Trie Data Structure

This is the code for an interactive guide to the Trie data structure, written in [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [VX](https://vx-demo.now.sh/).

It's currently under construction, but if you would like to check it out, you can run it by cd'ing into the `site` folder and running `npm run dev` in your terminal.
