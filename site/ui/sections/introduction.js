    <h1>The Trie Data Structure</h1>
    <h3>An Interactive Explaination</h3>

    <p>
      A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree data structure that is used to store Strings. It's generally used to search and store by prefix, which is why it is also known as a "prefix tree."
    </p>

    <p>
      Tries can often come up in software engineering interviews, however they aren't generally taught in a typical Data Structures course. Like all data structures, they're often better understood by interacting with them.

    <p>
      This guide will feature written explainations, code samples, and interactive working Tries. You can find the code for the guide itself <a href="https://github.com/Flaque/data-structures"> on Github</a>, along with it's implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/Flaque/data-structures/blob/master/site/packages/trie/index.js">Trie in Javascript.</a>
